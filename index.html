      <p lang="en">"Sometimes you have to shut your eyes, so you can see the real beauty.
  
  To be truly positive in the eyes of some, you have to risk appearing negative in the eyes of others.
  
  God is a comedian playing to an audience too afraid to laugh.
  
  Take time like the river that never grows stale. Keep going and steady. No hurry, no rush.
  
  Maybe you are searching among the branches, for what only appears in the roots.
  
  Do not be lured by the need to be liked: better to be respected, even feared.
  
  There’s always some truth behind “just kidding”, knowledge behind every “I don’t know”, emotions behind “I don’t care” and pain behind “it’s okay”.
  
  We can see through others only when we can see through ourselves.
  
  You who suffer because you love, love still more. To die of love is to live by it.
  
  The wind howls, but the mountain remains still.
  
  What makes night within us may leave stars."</p>

      <blockquote>
        “Success is going from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm.” |Winston Churchill |
  "
      </blockquote>
  
      <p>Getting knocked around by failures is never fun or easy, but this advice from Churchill reminds us that it’s vital that you remain enthusiastic when facing your next venture, or you can expect more of the same. It’s not an easy task, but it’s clear to see that if you let your defeats get you down you only make it harder to get that next success under your belt. Make an effort to get enthusiastic about your current endeavor, regardless of how many times you’ve fallen short in the past. This is sure to result in a success or two, which builds momentum and makes it easier to get excited about what you’ll do next.</p>
